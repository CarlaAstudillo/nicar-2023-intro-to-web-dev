## Github

Github is the platform that coders and developers use to collaborate and work on projects together. It’s great tool for other web developers to create and review code. It’s also excellent for version control to keep track and explore all changes done to your project.

In fact, you’re using Github at this moment. You downloaded the class materials for this class and are reading a README file that’s hosted on Github. It’s an extremely useful tool!

Each project is organized into what is called a `repository`. You can add and change code using the main branch or create a new `branch` where the changes will be made as `commits` and merged to the main branch using `pull requests`. 

There’s a lot of terminology involved so don’t worry if you’re feeling a little lost. But below are some links to some reading and tutorials to get you started.

### Getting started on Github

First, make sure you [sign up for a Github account](https://github.com/join). It’s free with a few limited restrictions.  There are several options and perks [if you want to pay](https://github.com/pricing) though.

Github itself has a [great beginners tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) where they go over the basics on how to set up and use. They also provide a [great Git Cheatsheet ](https://training.github.com/) in all languages. 

You can use Github through a Desktop app. Here’s a few tutorials to get you started.

However,  in order to get the most of out of Github, you can use your Git in your terminal.

Here’s a guide on how to [install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) on your computer.
