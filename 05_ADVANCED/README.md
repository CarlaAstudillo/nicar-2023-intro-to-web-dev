## Github

Github is the platform that coders and developers use to collaborate and work on projects together. It’s great tool for other web developers to create and review code. It’s also excellent for version control to keep track and explore all changes done to your project.

In fact, you’re using Github at this moment. You downloaded the class materials for this class and are reading a README file that’s hosted on Github. It’s an extremely useful tool!

Each project is organized into what is called a `repository`. You can add and change code using the main branch or create a new `branch` where the changes will be made as `commits` and merged to the main branch using `pull requests`.

There’s a lot of terminology involved so don’t worry if you’re feeling a little lost. But below are some links to some reading and tutorials to get you started.

### Getting started on Github

First, make sure you [sign up for a Github account](https://github.com/join). It’s free with a few limited restrictions. There are several options and perks [if you want to pay](https://github.com/pricing) though.

Github itself has a [great beginners tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) where they go over the basics on how to set up and use. They also provide a [great Git Cheatsheet ](https://training.github.com/) in all languages.

You can use Github through a Desktop app. Here’s a few tutorials to get you started.

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) - from Github
- [Here’s another simple tutorial to follow](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/github-desktop-tutorial/)
- [Github Desktop Tutorial – A Really, Really Simple Guide](https://www.classicpress.net/github-desktop-a-really-really-simple-tutorial/) - includes an explanation of terms
- [If you prefer a video tutorial](https://youtu.be/0nzJXJAhlsk)

However, in order to get the most of out of Github, you can use your Git in your terminal.

Here’s a guide on how to [install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) on your computer.

And here’s a few tutorials to get you started as well:

- [Command line Git | GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html)
- [Basic Git Commands – How to Use Git in a Real Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-basic-git-and-github-commands/)
- [An Intro to Git and GitHub for Beginners (Tutorial)](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)
- [If you prefer a video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)
- [Another video tutorial](https://youtu.be/HJAwAKwFX-A)

- [The Advanced Git Guide: Git Stash, Reset, Rebase, and More](https://www.toptal.com/git/the-advanced-git-guide)
- [13 Advanced (but useful) Git Techniques and Shortcuts](https://youtu.be/ecK3EnyGD8o)

Finally, Github’s README use a language called Markdown which is a markup language for formatting text. Here’s a good guide to [getting started](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) along with an [explanation of basic syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) on how to use Markdown.

## Node.js

JavaScript is the language of the Web and its main purpose is to run into a browser. But it can also run locally on your computer or a server, without a browser! And when it does, we call it [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Being able to code for the Web, but also for pretty much anything else (crunching and scraping data, for example) makes JavaScript an extraordinarily versatile language.

[For tutorials, check here.](https://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers)

Another reason why Node.js is very interesting is [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/). When you install Node.js on your computer, you automatically have access to NPM. The Node Package Manager is a huge library of JavaScript libraries. Most of the time, open-source libraries are hosted on GitHub and published on NPM.

NPM makes the installation of external libraries very easy. For example, to install the latest version of [simple-data-analysis](https://github.com/nshiab/simple-data-analysis.js), you simply have to type `npm install simple-data-analysis` in your terminal.

For each of your projects, NPM will keep a `package.json` file in your repository. This file will track every version of every library that you use. This is very useful when you work as a team or when you share your code publicly. By cloning your code and running `npm install` in the terminal, everybody will have the exact same library versions as you.

## Frameworks / React

In JavaScript, a framework is special type of library that provides a set of tools and features to make it easier to build web applications. Frameworks can help streamline the development process by providing a structure and a set of conventions for building applications. They can also save time and effort by handling common tasks. Rather than starting from scratch and having to bring all the pieces together like we've done today, frameworks can often help jumpstart a new project. The cost is that the more a framework can save you time, the more assumptions and opinions it likely has about _how_ you should build it. In some cases, these frontend frameworks even make you use new languages (often dervied from HTML/CSS/JavaScript). The best framework to use is the one that's best for your particular usecase.

Frameworks come in all kinds of flavors, but the most applicable ones for web development are frontend frameworks – the most common of which are:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) _(ol' reliable, by far the most commonly used)_
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) _(has a solid, loyal following)_
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) _(not in vogue, but it was first so still used)_
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) & [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) _(the "new kids" on the block)_
- [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) _(I've never heard of it, but apparently it's the newer popular kid)_
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) _(the simplest the start with, IMO)_

Don't take my word for it. One great resource to keep an eye on every year is the ["State of JavaScript"](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/) survey sent out to thousands of JavaScript developers across many industries. While the basics of HTML/CSS/JavaScript presented today have stood the test of time – it can be fun to peak at what the latest and greatest is.

If you want to learn more about frameworks, I recommend looking at [the the class I taught at NICAR 2022](https://github.com/brizandrew/nicar-2022-javascript-103) on the subject.
