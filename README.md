## How to fetch Github
First things first, you will need to fetch the class materials that you will need from a site called Github. The page that you are on currently is the Github repository for our class. Github is a platform where web developers can store, manage, track and control changes in code. It's great for collaboration. You will learn more about what it can do in the Advance Technique sections of our course.

However, for this class, you just simply fetch the materials by clicking the Code button in the top right of this Github repository. Click `Download ZIP` which will download the zip files of this whole repository into your local computer. Your files might be in the `Downloads` folder so make sure to move them to `Desktop` so you always know where they are.
