# JavaScript

Welcome to the JavaScript portion of the class. JavaScript is a powerful and versatile programming language that is widely used for building interactive web applications, creating dynamic user interfaces, and developing server-side applications. In this lesson plan, you will learn the basics of JavaScript programming, including data types, variables, operators, functions, decisions, and loops. You will also explore more advanced topics, such as loading data and using libraries from the web. By the end of this lesson plan, you will have a solid foundation in JavaScript programming and be ready to learn more through experimentation and further research.
