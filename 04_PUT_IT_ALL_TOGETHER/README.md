# Putting it all together

We are now going to use everything we learned to make a simple website with an image and show data loaded using Javascript.

## Exercise #1: Set up the HTML page with a image

If you need a refresher, you go back to the [HTML section](https://github.com/CarlaAstudillo/nicar-2023-intro-to-web-dev/tree/main/01_HTML).

* Set up the HTML body template (You can copy and paste from [`here`](../00_EXCERCISES/02_HTML_EXAMPLE/index.html))
* Add a title at the top, with a subhead, some text explaining what the site is about and a link.
* Add an image to the page
* Add a simple HTML table with a class name

## Exercise #2: Make it pretty using CSS

If you need a refresher, you go back to the [CSS section](https://github.com/CarlaAstudillo/nicar-2023-intro-to-web-dev/tree/main/02_CSS).

* Create a CSS file and connect it to your HTML file
* Change the background color
* Change the fonts
* Center the images and the div elements on the page
* Make the HTML table pretty

## Load in data into the HTML table using Javascript

If you need a refresher, you go back to the [Javascript section](https://github.com/CarlaAstudillo/nicar-2023-intro-to-web-dev/tree/main/03_JAVASCRIPT).

* Set up a local web server
* Get clean data that can be loaded
* Use Javascript to load the data
* Use Javascript to loop through the data
* Write a Javascript function
