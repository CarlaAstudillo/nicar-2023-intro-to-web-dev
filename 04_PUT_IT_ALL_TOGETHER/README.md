# Putting it all together

We are now going to use everything we learned to make a simple website with an image and show data loaded using Javascript.

## Exercise #1: Set up the HTML page with a image

Set up the following:

* A Chrome web server
* The HTML body template (You can copy and paste from here)
* Add a title at the top, with a subhead, some text explaining what the site is about and a link.
* Add an image to the page (hint on how to do that here)
* Add a simple HTML table with a class name (hint on how to do that here)
