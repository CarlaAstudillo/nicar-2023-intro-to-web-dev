## CSS Properties

To change the appearance or the behavior of an HTML element, you can assign it a CSS property.

And there are a [loooooot of them](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/index.php)!

### Setup

To test the most important ones, we are going to use a stylesheet and an HTML file.

In the stylesheet, we will add our CSS.

_style.css_

```css
/* Some css in here. */
```

And in our HTML file, we need to reference our stylesheet and we will add a simple div element, with some [cat ipsum](http://www.catipsum.com/) in it.

_index.html_

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      Pet me pet me pet me pet me, bite, scratch, why are you petting me make
